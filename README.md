## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

While working on the project, I enhanced my skills on HTML components. usage of div was replaced by using main and section.
Also, flex box was used to convert the mobile site to the desktop version which made the transiotion smooth

### Continued development

Need to improve the understading of hover, before and after attributes in css.
